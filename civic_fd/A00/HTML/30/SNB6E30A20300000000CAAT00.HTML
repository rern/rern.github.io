Depending on the failure, a DTC is stored in either the first or the second drive cycle. When a DTC is stored, the ECM/PCM turns on the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) by supplying ground to the MIL circuit.<br><br><ul><li><b>One Drive Cycle Detection Method</b><br>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another control unit, the ECM/PCM stores a DTC for the failure in the RAM and turns on the MIL immediately.<br><li><br><li><b>Two Drive Cycle Detection Method</b><br>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another control unit in the first drive cycle, the  ECM/PCM stores a Temporary DTC for the failure in RAM. The MIL does not come on at this time. If the failure continues in the second drive cycle, the ECM/PCM stores a DTC in erasable memory and turns on the MIL.<br></ul><br><a name="iT02"></a><h4><b>Fail-safe Function</b></h4>When an abnormality occurs in the signal from a sensor or from another control unit, the ECM/PCM ignores that signal and substitute a pre-programmed value, for them that allows the engine to continue running. This causes a DTC to be stored and the MIL to come on.<br><br><a name="iT03"></a><h4><b>MIL Bulb Check</b></h4>When the ignition switch is turned ON (II), the ECM/PCM supplies ground to the MIL circuit for 2 seconds to check the bulb condition.<br><br><a name="iT04"></a><h4><b>Self Shut Down (SSD) Mode</b></h4>After the ignition switch is turned OFF, the ECM/PCM stays on (up to 15 minutes). If the ECM/PCM connector is disconnected during this time, the ECM/PCM may be damaged. To cancel this mode, disconnect the negative cable from the battery or jump the SCS line with the HDS after the ignition switch is turned OFF.<br></body></html>
