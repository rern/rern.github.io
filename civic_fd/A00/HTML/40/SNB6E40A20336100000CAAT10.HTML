Fuel cutoff control also occurs when the engine speed exceeds 6,900 rpm (min<sup><small>-1</small></sup>), regardless of the position of the throttle valve, to protect the engine from over-revving. When the vehicle is stopped, the ECM/PCM cuts the fuel at engine speeds over 5,000 rpm (min<sup><small>-1</small></sup>). Engine speed of fuel cut is lower on a cold engine.<br><br><a name="iT04"></a><h4><b>Fuel Pump Control</b></h4>When the ignition is turned on, the ECM/PCM grounds  PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP) which feeds current to the fuel pump for 2 seconds to pressurize the fuel system. With the engine running, the ECM/PCM grounds PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP) and feeds current to the fuel pump. When the engine is not running and the ignition is on, the ECM/PCM cuts ground to PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP) which cuts current to the fuel pump.<br><br><a name="iT05"></a><h4><b>PGM-FI Main Relay 1 and 2</b></h4>PGM-FI main relay 1 (C) is energized whenever the ignition switch is ON (II) to supply battery voltage to the ECM/PCM, power to the injectors, and power for PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP). PGM-FI main relay 2 (FUEL PUMP) is energized to supply power to the fuel pump for 2 seconds when the ignition switch is turned ON (II), and when the engine is cranking or running.<br></body></html>
