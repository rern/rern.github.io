For the system to arm, the ignition switch must be off, the key must be removed from the ignition switch, and the MICU must receive signals that the doors, hood, and trunk are closed and locked. The alarm can be disarmed at any time by unlocking the driver's door with the key or pressing the UNLOCK button on the transmitter.<br><br>When everything is closed and locked, the only inputs that are grounded, and have 0 V, are the driver's door lock knob switch (LOCK position), and the audio unit. In otherwords, all of the other switches are open, and have about 10 to 12 V, including the key cylinder switches. The security indicator in the gauge control module (speedo) begins to flash immediately after the vehicle is completely closed and locked, and 15 seconds later, the security system arms. If the security indicator does not flash, the system is not arming. A beep sounds and position lights flash to confirm the security alarm system is armed if the LOCK button is pressed a second time within 5 seconds.<br><br>If one of the switches is misadjusted or shorted internally, or there is a short in the circuit, the security system will not arm. As long as the control unit continues to receive a ground signal (0 V) , it senses that the vehicle is not closed and locked , and the system will not arm. A switch that is slightly misadjusted can cause the alarm to sound for no apparent reason. In this case, a significant change in outside air temperature, the vibration of a passing truck, or someone bumping into the vehicle could cause the alarm to sound. There is no glass breakage or motion detector feature.<br><br>If anything is opened or improperly unlocked after the system is armed, the control unit receives a ground signal from that switch, and the 10 to 12 V reference drops to 0 V . If the audio unit connector is disconnected, the input loses its ground, and the input voltage goes to 10 to 12 V. The system sounds the alarm when any of these occur:<br><br><ul><li>A door or the trunk is forced open<br><li>A door is unlocked without using the key or the transmitter<br><li>The hood is opened<br><li>The audio unit is disconnected<br></ul><br>When the system sounds the alarm, the horns sound and the exterior lights flash for 2 minutes. The alarm can be stopped at any time by unlocking the driver's door with the key or by pressing any button on the transmitter.<br><br><a name="iS02"></a><h3><b>Keyless Entry System</b></h3><br>The keyless entry system is integrated with the MICS . The MICS receives LOCK and UNLOCK signals from the immobilizer-keyless control unit (with built-in receiver).<br>The keyless entry system allows you to lock and unlock the vehicle with the transmitter. When you press the LOCK button, all doors lock.<br>When you press the UNLOCK button once, only the driver's door unlocks. The other doors will unlock when you press the button a second time.<br><br>The doors will not lock with the transmitter if a door is not fully closed , or if the key is in the ignition switch.<br><br>When the switch for the ceiling light is in the center (DOOR) position, it will come on when UNLOCK button is pressed. If a door is not opened, the light will go off in about 30 seconds, and the doors will relock. If the doors are locked with the transmitter within 30 seconds, the light will go off immediately.<br></body></html>
