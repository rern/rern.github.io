This indicates that the LED and its circuit are operating correctly.<br>If there is a failure in the system after the engine is started, the EPS indicator will stay on, and the power assist is turned off.<br><br>When EPS indicator comes on, the control unit memorizes the DTC. In this case, the control unit will not activate the EPS system after the engine starts again, but it keeps the EPS indicator on.<br><br>When DTC 51-01, 51-02 or 51-06 is stored in the control unit, the EPS indicator will stay on until the DTC is erased. When a problem is detected and the EPS indicator comes on, there are cases when the indicator stays on until the ignition switch is turned OFF, and cases when the indicator goes off automatically when the system returns to normal. Even though the system is operating normally, the EPS indicator will come on under the following conditions:<br><br><ul><li>The vehicle speed decreases abruptly from 20 km/h (12 mph) or more (by applying brake), and it is less than 1 km/h (1 mph) and engine speed is 2,000 rpm (min<sup><small>-1</small></sup>) or above for 5 seconds (continuously) after the abrupt deceleration.<br><li>While turning the steering wheel with the vehicle speed of 1 km/h (1 mph) or less for  20 seconds, and the engine speed is 2,000 rpm (min<sup><small>-1</small></sup>) or above for at least  10 seconds.<br><li>When the engine speed is 500 rpm (min<sup><small>-1</small></sup>) or less, and the vehicle is travelling at a speed of 10 km/h (6 mph) or more for about 3 seconds.<br></ul><br>To determine the actual cause of the problem, question the customer about the conditions during which the problem occured, taking the above conditions into consideration.<br><a name="iS02"></a><h2><b>Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)</b></h2><br><ul><li>If the CPU cannot be activated, or it fails, the EPS indicator comes on, but the DTC is not memorized.<br><li>The memory can hold any number of DTCs. However, when the same DTC is detected more than once, the most recent DTC is written over the prior DTC, therefore only one occurance is memorized.<br><li>The lowest DTC is indicated first. The DTCs are indicated in ascending order, not in the order that they occurred.<br><li>The DTCs are memorized in the EEPROM (non-volatile memory) therefore the memorized DTCs cannot be erased by disconnecting the battery. Perform the specified procedures to clear DTCs.<br></ul><br><a name="iS03"></a><h2><b>Self-diagnosis</b></h2><br>Self-diagnosis can be classified into three categories:<br><br><ul><li>Initial diagnosis: Performed right after the engine starts and until the EPS indicator goes off.<br><li>Regular diagnosis: Performed right after the initial diagnosis until the ignition switch is turned OFF.<br><li>Steering diagnosis: Performed in case of steering during the regular diagnosis.<br></ul><br>The EPS control unit performs the following functions when a problem is detected by self-diagnosis:<br><br><p><table cols="2" width="100%"><tr><td id="i010" width="1%" valign="top" nowrap>1.</td><td valign="top" width="99%">Turns on the EPS indicator.<br><br></td></tr></table></p><p><table cols="2" width="100%"><tr><td id="i020" width="1%" valign="top" nowrap>2.</td><td valign="top" width="99%">Memorizes the DTC.<br><br></td></tr></table></p><p><table cols="2" width="100%"><tr><td id="i030" width="1%" valign="top" nowrap>3.</td><td valign="top" width="99%">Stops power assist and manual steering operation resumes.<br><br>NOTE: For DTCs 11-01, 11-02, 12-01, 21-01, 21-02, 22-01 and  35-04 the EPS indicator will go off automatically, and the system returns to normal.<br></td></tr></table></p><a name="iS04"></a><h2><b>Restriction on Power Assist Operation</b></h2><br>Repeated extreme steering force, such as turning the steering wheel continuously back-and-forth with the vehicle stopped, causes an increase of power consumption in the EPS motor. The increase of electric current causes the motor to heat up. Because this heat adversely affects the system, the control unit monitors the electric current of the motor.<br><br>When the control unit detects heat build-up in the motor, it reduces the electric current to the motor gradually to protect the system, and it restricts the power assist operation. The EPS indicator does not come on during this function.<br><br>When steering torque is not applied to the steering wheel, or when the ignition is turned off and the motor cools, the control unit will restore the power assist gradually until it's fully restored (after about 8 minutes).<br><br><a name="iS05"></a><h2><b>Torque Sensor Neutral Position</b></h2><br>The EPS control unit stores the torque sensor neutral position in the EEPROM. The torque sensor neutral position must be memorized whenever the gearbox, the motor or EPS control unit is replaced.<br><br>NOTE: The torque sensor neutral position is not effected when erasing the DTCs.<br><a name="iS06"></a><h2><b>How to Troubleshoot DTCs</b></h2><br>The troubleshooting procedures assume that the cause of the problem is still present and the EPS indicator is still on.
