However, when the same DTC is detected more than once, the more recent DTC is written over the earlier one. Therefore, when the same problem is detected repeatedly, it is memorized as a single DTC.<br><li>The DTCs are indicated in the order they occur.<br><li>The DTCs are memorized in the EEPROM. Therefore, the memorized DTCs cannot be canceled by disconnecting the battery.
