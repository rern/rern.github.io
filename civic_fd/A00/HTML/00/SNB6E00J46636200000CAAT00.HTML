This system consists of a transponder combined with a keyless transmitter, immobilizer-keyless control unit, MICU (has built in the imoes unit)<sup><small>*</small></sup>, an immobilizer indicator, and the ECM/PCM.<br><p>When the immobilizer key (programmed by the HDS) is inserted into the ignition switch and turned to the ON (II) position, the immobilizer-keyless control unit sends power to the transponder in the ignition key. The transponder then sends a coded signal back to the immobilizer-keyless control unit which then sends a coded signal to the ECM/PCM and the MICU (imoes unit)<sup><small>*</small></sup>.<br>The ECM/PCM and the MICU (imoes unit) identify this coded signal, then fuel power is supplied.<br><br>NOTE: The transmitter is automatically programmed to the vehicle when a transponder is programmed by the HDS.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(1,gESM.iDT[0],512);</script></div></p></p><ul><li>If the wrong key has been used or the code was not received or recognized by the unit, the indicator will come on for about 2 seconds, then it will blink until the ignition switch is turned OFF. When the ignition switch is turned OFF, the indicator will blink ten times to signal that the unit has reset correctly, then the indicator will go off.<br><li>If the customer has lost their key, and cannot start the engine, contact Honda Customer Relations.<br></ul></body></html>
