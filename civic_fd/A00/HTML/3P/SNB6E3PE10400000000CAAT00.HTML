The entire unit is positioned in line with the engine.<br><br><a name="iT01"></a><h4><b>Torque Converter, Shafts, Gears, and Clutches</b></h4>The torque converter consists of a pump, turbine, and stator assembly in a single unit. The converter housing (pump) is connected to the engine crankshaft and turns as the engine turns. Around the outside of the torque converter is a ring gear which meshes with the starter pinion when the engine is being started. The entire torque converter assembly serves as a flywheel while transmitting power to the transmission mainshaft. The transmission has three parallel shafts; the mainshaft, the countershaft and the secondary shaft. The mainshaft is in line with the engine crankshaft, and includes the 3rd and 5th clutches, and gears for 3rd, 5th, reverse, and idler. The mainshaft reverse gear is integral with the mainshaft 5th gear. The countershaft includes the gears for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th-5th, reverse, park, and the final drive. The countershaft 4th-5th gear enables the shared use of the secondary shaft 4th gear and the mainshaft 5th gear. The countershaft 4th-5th gear and the countershaft reverse gear can be locked to the countershaft providing the 4th,  5th or reverse gear, depending on which way the selector is moved. The final drive gear is integral with the countershaft. The secondary shaft includes the 1st, 2nd, and 4th clutches, and gears for 1st, 2nd, 4th, and idler. The idler gear shaft is located between the mainshaft and secondary shaft, and the idler gear transmits power between the mainshaft and the secondary shaft. The gears on the mainshaft and the secondary shaft are in constant mesh with those on the countershaft. When certain combinations of gears in the transmission are engaged by the clutches, power is transmitted through the mainshaft, then to the secondary shaft to the countershaft provide drive.<br><br><a name="iT02"></a><h4><b>Electronic Control</b></h4>The electronic control system consists of the powertrain control module (PCM), sensors, and seven solenoid valves. Shifting and lock-up are electronically controlled for comfortable driving under all conditions. The PCM is located in the engine compartment.<br><br><a name="iT03"></a><h4><b>Hydraulic Control</b></h4>The valve bodies include the main valve body, the regulator valve body, and the servo body. They are bolted to the torque converter housing. The main valve body contains the manual valve, the cut B valve, the shift valves A, C, and D, the relief valve, the lock-up control valve, the cooler check valve, the servo control valve, and the ATF pump gears. The regulator valve body contains the regulator valve, the torque converter check valve, the lock-up shift valve, the 1st accumulator, and the 3rd accumulator. The servo body contains the servo valve, the shift valve B, the cut A valve, accumulators for 2nd, 4th, and 5th, and shift solenoid valves for A, B, C, and D. Fluid from the regulator passes through the manual valve to the various control valves. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clutches receive fluid from their respective feed pipes, and the 1st and the 5th clutches receive fluid from the internal hydraulic circuit.<br><br><a name="iT04"></a><h4><b>Shift Control Mechanism</b></h4>To shift gears, the PCM controls shift solenoid valves A, B, C, and D, and automatic transaxle (A/T) clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C, while receiving input signals from various sensors and switches located throughout the vehicle. The shift solenoid valves shift the positions of the shift valves to switch the port to send hydraulic pressure to the clutch. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C regulate their respective pressure, and pressurize to the clutches to engage it and its corresponding gear.<br><a name="iT05"></a><h4><b>Lock-up Mechanism</b></h4>The lock-up mechanism operates in the D position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th), and D3 position (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). The pressurized fluid is drained from the back of the torque converter through a fluid passage, causing the torque converter clutch piston to be held against the torque converter cover. As this takes place, the mainshaft rotates at the same speed as the engine crankshaft. Together with the hydraulic control, the PCM optimizes the timing and volume of the lock-up mechanism. When the shift solenoid valve D is turned on by the PCM, shift solenoid valve D pressure switches the lock-up shift valve lock-up on and off. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A and the lock-up control valve control the volume of the lock-up conditions.<br><br><a name="iT06"></a><h4><b>Gear Selection - 7-position Automatic Transmission</b></h4>The shift lever has seven positions; P: PARK, R: REVERSE, N: NEUTRAL, D: DRIVE 1st through 5th gear ranges, D3: DRIVE 1st through 3rd gear ranges, 2: 2nd gear, and 1: 1st gear.<br><br><p><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" class="All"><thead><tr><th width="15%" class="RB" align="center" valign="top">Position&nbsp;</th><th width="85%" class="B" align="center" valign="top">Description&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td width="15%" class="RB" align="left" valign="top">P: PARK&nbsp;</td><td width="85%" class="B" align="left" valign="top">Front wheels locked; park pawl engaged with park gear on countershaft.
