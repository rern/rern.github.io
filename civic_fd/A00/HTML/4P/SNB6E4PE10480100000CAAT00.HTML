The ATF pump is driven by splines on the left end of the torque converter which is attached to the engine. Fluid flows through the regulator valve to maintain specified pressure through the main valve body to the manual valve, directing pressure to the shift valves and to each of the clutches via the solenoid valves. The shift solenoid valves A, B, C, D, and E are bolted on the servo body. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C are mounted on the outside of the transmission housing.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(1,gESM.iDT[0],512);</script></div></p></p><a name="iT02"></a><h4><b>Main Valve Body</b></h4><p>The main valve body contains the manual valve, the shift valves A, B, C, and E, the relief valve, the lock-up control valve, the cooler check valve, the servo control valve, and the ATF pump gears. The primary function of the main valve body is to switch fluid pressure on and off and to control hydraulic pressure going to the hydraulic control system.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(2,gESM.iDT[1],512);</script></div></p></p><a name="iT03"></a><h4><b>Regulator Valve Body</b></h4><p>The regulator valve body contains the regulator valve, the torque converter check valve, lock-up shift valve, and the  1st and 3rd accumulators.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(3,gESM.iDT[2],512);</script></div></p></p><a name="iS02"></a><h3><b>Hydraulic Controls</b> <b>(cont'd)</b></h3><br><a name="iT04"></a><h4><b>Regulator Valve</b></h4><p>The regulator valve maintains a constant hydraulic pressure from the ATF pump to the hydraulic control system, while also furnishing fluid to the lubrication system and torque converter. The fluid from the ATF pump flows through B and C. Fluid entering from B flows through the valve orifice to the A cavity. This pressure of the A cavity pushes the regulator valve to valve spring side, and this movement of the regulator valve uncovers the fluid port to the torque converter and the relief valve. The fluid flows out to the torque converter and the relief valve, and the regulator valve returns under spring force. According to the level of the hydraulic pressure through B, the position of the regulator valve changes, and the amount of fluid from C through torque converter also changes. This operation is continued, maintaining the line pressure.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(4,gESM.iDT[3],512);</script></div></p></p><p>Increases in hydraulic pressure according to torque are performed by the regulator valve using stator torque reaction. The stator shaft is splined with the stator in the torque converter, and its arm end contacts the regulator spring cap. When the vehicle is accelerating or climbing (torque converter range), stator torque reaction acts on the stator shaft, and the stator arm pushes the regulator spring cap in the direction of the arrow in proportion to the reaction. The stator reaction spring compresses, and the regulator valve moves to increase the line pressure which is regulated by the regulator valve. The line pressure reaches its maximum when the stator torque reaction reaches its maximum.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(5,gESM.iDT[4],512);</script></div></p></p><a name="iT05"></a><h4><b>Servo Body</b></h4><p>The servo body contains the servo valve, the shift valve D, accumulators for 2nd, 4th, and 5th, and shift solenoid valves for A, B, C, D, and E.<br><p class="FIG">&nbsp;<div class="FIG"><script>FIL(6,gESM.iDT[5],512);</script></div></p></p><a name="iT06"></a><h4><b>Accumulator</b></h4><p>The accumulators are located in the regulator valve body and the servo body.
