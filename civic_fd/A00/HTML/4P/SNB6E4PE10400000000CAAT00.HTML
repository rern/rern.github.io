The entire unit is positioned in line with the engine.<br><br><a name="iT01"></a><h4><b>Torque Converter, Gears, and Clutches</b></h4>The torque converter consists of a pump, turbine, and stator assembly in a single unit. The converter housing (pump) is connected to the engine crankshaft and turn as the engine turns. Around the outside of the torque converter is a ring gear which meshes with the starter pinion when the engine is being started. The entire torque converter assembly serves as a flywheel while transmitting power to the transmission mainshaft, the transmission has three parallel shafts; the mainshaft, the countershaft and the secondary shaft. The mainshaft is in line with the engine crankshaft, and includes the 4th and 5th clutches, and gears for 5th, 4th, reverse, and idler. The mainshaft reverse gear is integral with the mainshaft 4th gear. The countershaft includes the gears for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, reverse, park, and the final drive. The final drive gear is integral with the countershaft. The countershaft 4th gear and the countershaft reverse gear can be locked to the countershaft providing the 4th or reverse gear, depending on which way the selector is moved. The secondary shaft includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd clutches, and gears for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and idler. The idler shaft is located between the mainshaft and secondary shaft, and the idler gear transmits power between the mainshaft and the secondary shaft. The gears on the mainshaft and the secondary shaft are in constant mesh with those on the countershaft. When certain combinations of gears in the transmission are engaged by the clutches, power is transmitted through the mainshaft, then to the secondary shaft to the countershaft provide drive.<br><br><a name="iT02"></a><h4><b>Electronic Control</b></h4>The electronic control system consists of the powertrain control module (PCM), sensors, and solenoid valves. Shifting and lock-up are electronically controlled for comfortable driving under all conditions. The PCM is located in the engine compartment.<br><br><a name="iT03"></a><h4><b>Hydraulic Control</b></h4>The valve bodies include the main valve body, the regulator valve body, and the servo body. They are bolted to the torque converter housing. The main valve body contains the manual valve, the shift valves A, B, C, and E, the relief valve, the lock-up control valve, the cooler check valve, the servo control valve, and the ATF pump gears. The regulator valve body contains the regulator valve, the torque converter check valve, lock-up shift valve, and the 1st and 3rd accumulators. The servo body contains the servo valve, the shift valve D, accumulators for 2nd, 4th, and 5th, and shift solenoid valves for A, B, C, D, and E. Fluid from the regulator passes through the manual valve to the various control valves. The 1st, 3rd, and 5th clutches receive fluid from their respective feed pipes, and the 2nd and the 4th clutches receive fluid from the internal hydraulic circuit.<br><br><a name="iT04"></a><h4><b>Shift Control Mechanism</b></h4>The PCM controls to shift gears the shift solenoid valves A, B, C, D, and E, and the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C, while receiving input signals from various sensors and switches located throughout the vehicle. The shift solenoid valves shift the positions of the shift valves to switch the port leading hydraulic pressure to the clutch. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves A, B, and C regulate their respective pressure, and pressurize to the clutches to engage it and its corresponding gear. The pressures of the A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valves also apply to the shift valves to switch the port.<br><br><a name="iT05"></a><h4><b>Lock-up Mechanism</b></h4>The lock-up mechanism operates in D and S positions (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th). The pressurized fluid is drained from the back of the torque converter through a fluid passage, causing the torque converter clutch piston to be held against the torque converter cover. As this takes place, the mainshaft rotates at the same speed as the engine crankshaft. Together with the hydraulic control, the PCM optimizes the timing and volume of the lock-up mechanism. When the shift solenoid valve E is turned on by the PCM, shift solenoid valve E pressure switches the lock-up shift valve lock-up on and off. The A/T clutch pressure control solenoid valve A and the lock-up control valve control the volume of the lock-up conditions.<br><a name="iT06"></a><h4><b>Gear Selection</b></h4>The shift lever has five positions; P: PARK, R: REVERSE, N: NEUTRAL, D: DRIVE 1st through 5th gear ranges, S: DRIVE 1st through 5th gear ranges with S-position automatic shift and sequential shift.<br><br><p><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" class="All"><thead><tr><th width="31%" colspan="2" class="RB" align="center" valign="top">Position&nbsp;</th><th width="69%" class="B" align="center" valign="top">Description&nbsp;</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td width="31%" colspan="2" class="RB" align="left" valign="top">P: PARK&nbsp;</td><td width="69%" class="B" align="left" valign="top">Front wheels locked; park pawl engaged with park gear on countershaft.
