Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mutual mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mutual mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mutual mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside 
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin', please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah

La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, yeah, ridin' high
On love's true bluish lie

Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mutual mistrust, love's gone behind

In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do

La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
