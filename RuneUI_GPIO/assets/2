It's sad to think, we're not gonna make it
And it's gotten to the point where we just can't fake it (Ooo)
For some unGodly reason we just won't let it die (let it die)
I guess neither one of us (neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say good bye

I keep on wondering (wondering)
What I'm gonna do with out ya (do without you)
And I guess you must be wondering that same thing too (Ooo)
So we go on, go on together living a lie (living our lie)
Because neither one of us (neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say good bye
Oooooh ev'rytime I find the nerve
Everytime I find the nerve to say I'm leavin' (leavin')
Oh, memories, those old memories get in my way (my way my way)
Oh (Ooo) Lord knows it's only me only knows it's only me
That I'm deceiving
When it comes to saying good bye
That's a simple word that I just cannot say
There can be no way, there can be no way
This can have a happy ending (happy ending)
So we just go on (we go on) hurting and pretending
And convincing ourselves to give it just one more try (one more try)
Because neither one of us (Neither one of us)
Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us (neither one of us) Wants to be the first to say
Neither one of us (Neither one of us) wants to be the first to say
Farewell my love, goodbye (goodbye)
